# cheese-mvc-persistent
Java / Spring Boot studio
This is an assignment from the launchcode java skill track. The objectives were to work with the cheese-mvc 
application to add ORM functionality by using Spring Data. 

Some of the tasks that I completed were: 

Cloning an existing repo from github, importing into an IDE and then analyzing the code to see what next steps were needed.
Configuring a MySQL database to be used with Spring Data.
Creating new models and then configuring one-to-many and many-to-many relationship to be managed by Spring Data.
Persisting models with their appropriate relationships to a MySQL database.
